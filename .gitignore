# We might want to keep output if the user wants to use it for MkDocs pages hosted here, 
# but usually for a "tool" repo we ignore it. 
# However, if the goal is "publish", they might want the MDS.
# For now, let's IGNORE audio cache but KEEP output unless user says otherwise, 
# as they might want to see the examples. 
# Actually, strict rule: ignore .env is critical.
